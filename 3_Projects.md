These are some of my non-research projects, mostly implmenation and application/tools of either some NLP or HCI subtask. Most of these projects follow a central theme of being usefulness bolster with research. Most of these projects were identification of a pressing need in society which **needed** to be addressed computationally and tackled with Science. which needed to be tackled with NLP or HCI principles.

My research projects can be found [here](http://localhost:4000/research/).
