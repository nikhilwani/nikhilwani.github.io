Update: I'm on the job market! I'm happy to explore areas other than my expertise :) Please feel free to reach me at nwani@usc.edu!

Update: I'll be joining [VMware] (https://www.linkedin.com/company/vmware) in Palo Alto, CA this Fall! I'll be starting as a Member of Technical Staff III (Machine Learning Engineer) as part of their Propel Program. Looking forward! :)

Thank you for stopping by. I am a second-year CS graduate student in the [honors program](https://www.cs.usc.edu/academic-programs/masters/cs_ms_honors/) at the [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/) in sunny Los Angeles. I am currently working on my master's thesis that proposes new context-aware multidimensional dynamic representation for lexical complexity. My work currently achieves state-of-the-art on three NLP-ML shared tasks: 1. Complex phrase detection, 2. Complex word detection and 3. Grammatical sentence correctness detection, encapsulated for the eventual goal of Lexical Simplification.    

I want machines to not just ***learn***, but also ***understand*** complex ideas the way we do, especially with ***natural languages***.  I am also a ACM SIGCHI scholar and have some experience in Human Computer Interaction/ User Experience research.

Before joining USC, I spent two wonderful years (2017-19) as a Machine Learning Research Engineer in the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/) at **[IIT Bombay, India](https://www.iitb.ac.in/)**. I was advised by [Dr. Pushpak Bhattachary](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~pb/) at the [Center for Language Technology](http://www.cfilt.iitb.ac.in/). My research broadly focused on Machine Learning and Natural Language Understanding. 

During the summer of 2017, I worked on [Probabilistic Models for Intelligent Text Input Processing]() as a Machine Learning research intern in the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) group at the IDC School of Design (IDC Dept), IIT Bombay, India, where I was advised by **[Dr. Anirudha Joshi](http://www.idc.iitb.ac.in/~anirudha/){:target="_blank"}**.

In spring 2017, I worked on Multi-Scale, Multi-Channel 3D Convolutional Neural Network models during my internship at **Nvidia, Pune, India**, where I was lucky to be jointly advised by [Dr. CP Mammen](https://in.linkedin.com/in/cp-mammen-7690735) and [Dr. Jayashree Kalpathy Crammer](https://connects.catalyst.harvard.edu/Profiles/display/Person/102986) (MGH, Harvard Medical School).


I graduated in 2017 from VIT, Pune with distinction in Bachelors of Information Technology. Before that, I earned a Diploma in Computer Science Engineering with distinction from PCP, Pune in 2014.


In my spare time, I love playing cricket and participate in social events. I'm always looking for new, interesting people to interact with.
