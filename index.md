Thank you for stopping by. I am a Research Engineer in the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/) at [IIT Bombay, India](https://www.iitb.ac.in/). I am advised by **[Dr. Pushpak Bhattachary](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~pb/)**, and I am fortunate to be working closely with him at the [Center for Indian Language Technology](http://www.cfilt.iitb.ac.in/). My research broadly focuses on natural language understanding and machine learning.

<!-- A lot of my project target a social theme. 

I identify myself with the NLP(), HCI and ML Community.

I'm interest in Machine Learning, and have been gravitated towards Deep Semantics. Some of projects inlclude: -->

<!-- I am currently a Research Fellow in the Natural Language Processing group at the **[CFILT](http://www.cfilt.iitb.ac.in/) Lab, CSE Dept, IIT Bombay, India** under the ausÂ­pices of [**Dr. Pusphpak Bhattacharya**](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~pb/){:target="_blank"}, who spearheads NLP-AI research in India. Some of my early/intial contributions to the NLP community include: State-of-the-art Contextualy Complex Word Identification(CWI) system, Neural NER system.

<!--  I like spending most of my time experimenting with code and life.  -->
 I want machines to not just ***learn***, but also ***understand*** complex ideas the way we do, especially with ***natural langauges***. Last summer, I build a state-of-the-art [Contextually Complex Phrase detection]() system. 

  <!-- Some of my inital contributions to the NLP community include: State-of-the-art [Contextually Complex Word Identification System]() and [Neural Machine Translation System](). I've also worked on primary Natural Language Understanding tasks such as [Neural Machine Comprehension]() for Question Answering and [Supervised Sentiment Analysis]().

<!-- During the Summer of 2017, I interned at the **Industrail Design Center(IDC Dept), IIT Bombay**, and I was advised by [**Dr. Anirudha Joshi**](http://www.idc.iitb.ac.in/~anirudha/){:target="_blank"}, who leads HCI and Text Input research in India. I worked on my Thesis project: [Probabilistic Models for Intelligent Text Input Processing](). [Probabilistic Generative Models](), [Decoders]() and [Language Models for Intelligent Text Input]() Subsequently, having being selected to attend ACM [SIGCHI Summer School](https://indiahci.org/sigchischool/researchmethods2018/){:target="_blank"} on Research Methods this year (Summer 2018), I've had the chance to further explore Neural Language Modeling for Text Input Prediction. You can learn more about it [here]().  -->

<!-- I worked in the emerging field of Computational Interaction (Deep Learning + HCI) which can be found here - IFIP INTERACT 2017 PAPER, specifically Probabilistic Modeling for touch accuracy and Probabilistic Neural Decoding for Intelligent Text Entry. --> 
During the summer of 2017, I worked on [Probabilistic Models for Intelligent Text Input Processing]() as a research intern in the HCI group at Industrail Design Center (IDC Dept), IIT Bombay, India, where I was advised by **[Dr. Anirudha Joshi](http://www.idc.iitb.ac.in/~anirudha/){:target="_blank"}**.


In spring 2017, I worked on [Multi-Scale 3D Convolutional Neural Network models]() during my internship at **Nvidia, Pune, India**, where I was lucky to be jointly adviced by [Dr. CP Mammen](https://in.linkedin.com/in/cp-mammen-7690735) and [Dr. Jayashree Kalpathy Crammer](https://connects.catalyst.harvard.edu/Profiles/display/Person/102986) (MGH, Harvard Medical School).
