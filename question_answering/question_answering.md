**Context:** Hunter Biden, the president’s son, was charged on Thursday by federal prosecutors with lying about his drug use when he purchased a handgun in 2018 and with illegally possessing the weapon, setting up the potential for a trial coinciding with his father’s re-election campaign.

**Question:** 
- Who is the president's son?
- Why was he charged?
- When was he charged?
