<p> Hi there, thank you for stoping by. My name is Nikhil Wani (Sanskrit: निखिल). You can call me Nick. I like spending most of my time experiment with code and life. </p>

<p> At a very early stage in my career, I am greatful and lucky to have collaboratively worked with the following Ph.D students: <a href="https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~diptesh/" target="_blank">Diptesh Kanoji</a>(IITB-Monash University, Australia) , <a href="https://abhijitmishra.github.io/" target="_blank"> Dr. Abhijeet Mishra</a>(IBM Research) <a href = "https://www.quora.com/profile/Sandeep-Albert-Mathias" target="_blank" Sandeep Mathias </a>, <a href = "https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~rudra/" target="_blank">Rudra Murthy</a>(CFILT, IIT Bombay), <a href = "http://www.idc.iitb.ac.in/students/phd/SanjayGhosh.html" target="_blank"> Dr. Sanjay Ghosh </a>(IDC, IIT Bombay)  and Jayashree Gajam(HSS, IIT Bombay). </p>


<p> I've also enjoyed being a student volunteer(SV) and helped build the following top tier conferences in India: IndiaHCI 2016, IFIP INTERACT 2017 and ICON 2017. </p>
